            <h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE AND CURRENT STATE ?</h1>
            
            <p> Global level of climate action varies as of January 2022, when I provided my most recent report.
                 Numerous efforts, national regulations, municipal programs, international agreements, and individual acts are being taken in the fight
                  against climate change. Here are some salient features of the condition of climate action as of right now.

        <div id="sol1">
            <h2>INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS</h2>
            
            <p>
                The 2015 Paris Agreement continues to be the mainstay of global climate action. 
                In order to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally below 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels,
                 countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. However, different nations have made different amounts of 
                 progress toward reaching these goals.

            <br></p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="sol2">
            <h2>NATIONAL POLICIES</h2>
        
            <p>
                Many countries have implemented or updated policies to address climate change, including setting emissions reduction targets, 
                investing in renewable energy, promoting energy efficiency, and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms. However, 
                the stringency and effectiveness of these policies vary widely.
    
            <br></p>
        </div>

        <div id="sol3">
            <h2>RENEWABLE ENERGY</h2>

            <p>In many regions of the world, the switch to renewable energy sources, such solar and wind power, is still accelerating. 
                The comparative advantage of renewable energy over fossil fuels has increased due to technological developments and falling costs.
                 Nonetheless, efforts to gradually phase out fossil fuels encounter political and economic obstacles because they continue to
                  dominate the world's energy mix.
            <br></p>
        </div>

        <div id="sol4">
            <h2>CORPORATE ACTION</h2>

            <p>A growing number of businesses are realizing the potential and threats posed by climate change,
                 and many are implementing measures to lower their carbon footprint, improve sustainability,
                  and incorporate climate concerns into their overall business plans. But different businesses and industries have made different
                   amounts of progress, and certain industries are still criticized for not doing enough.
